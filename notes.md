in home.jas temporay added Checkout.jsx (dont know where should be added?)

Create acount---done
Login as admin---done
Login as user---done
Update user Details---done (it is working, user data are updated in database)
In page Update User Details button CHANGE PASSWORD it is not working???
Admin can Create Event----done (event is saved in database) (Events are created without image, I didnt know how to save images in database??)
When user is logged in he shouldnt see btn CREATE EVENT (how to hide that???) He also shouldnt be able to see EVENTS and USERS from nav bar

GET ALL EVENTS OF 1 USER???  PUT THAT IN EVENTPAGE instead of useGetAllEventsQuery
